        Accessing the latest research remains a challenge due to costly
        journals, traditional academic barriers, and outdated learning models.
        This creates a knowledge divide, preventing many, especially those
        outside top institutions, from staying current with advancements. This
        inequity not only limits individual growth but also hinders global
        innovation and economic progress.

          To bridge the gap in access to research, support continuous learning,
          and create a level playing field for all learners, we need to
          restructure the way research is accessed and how individuals engage
          with it. The existing system of academic research, with its siloed
          access and passive learning methods, is not sufficient for a world
          where knowledge evolves rapidly, and career success depends on
          continuous, dynamic learning.
